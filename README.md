## How it works

LetÂ´s start with the initialization of the application, besides registering all routes, modules and other needs, during initializion, the `dailymed-indications.controller` starts to listen for two events:

- **IndicationEvents.SCRAPE_INDICATIONS**: triggered by `task-runner.service` when `onApplicationBootstrap` is called, which scrape and parse the indications from DailyMed website, and stores it in a temporary file `tmp/dailymed-indications.json`.
- **IndicationEvents.MAP_INDICATIONS**: triggered by the same controller, runs after sucessfully scrape data from DailyMed website, then read the temporary file `tmp/dailymed-indications.json`, get the  ICD-10 code for each respective indication using a IA tool and stores it in sqlite database to be consumed by the api.

The events are registered in a cronjob to run every 24 hours.
